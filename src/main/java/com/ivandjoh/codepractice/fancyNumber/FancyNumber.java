 * Given a mobile number and some conditions for a fancy number,
 * find if the given number is fancy. A 10-digit mobile number is called fancy
 * if it satisfies any of the following three conditions.
 * - A single number occurs three consecutive times. Like 777.
 * Three consecutive digits are either in increasing or decreasing fashion. Like 456 or 987.
 * - A single digit occurs four or more times in the number. Like 9859009976 â€“ here the digit 9
 * occurs 4 times.

 * Example:
 * Input:  9859009976
 * Output: yes
 * The given mobile number satisfies condition three given above.

 * input:  7609438921
 * output: no
 * The given three conditions satisfy
